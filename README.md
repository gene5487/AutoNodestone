# AutoNodestone
Python program for MapleStory that help palyer find ideal combination of [Nodestones](https://maplestory.nexon.net/micro-site/59387).

- Uses [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) to automatic identify Nodestone Skills.
- Formulates the combination problem as an [Zero-one integer linear programming(0-1 ILP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming#Variants) problem.
- Uses [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) to solve the 0-1 ILP problem.
- Uses [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) as user interface.


## ‚úÖFeatures
- Nodestone Skills identification is based on [Template Matching](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/dc6/tutorial_py_template_matching.html), \
which theoretically **supports all languages** (as long as all Maplestory server share same skill icon).
- Batch scan all the 11 Nodestones on V-martix UI at once without any manual input.
- Intuitive and convenience UI. (See [Usage](usage))


## üî®Setup 
1. Download and install Python3.
2. Download and unzip AutoNodestone.
3. Inside your AutoNodestone directory, open a command prompt and run : 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
>üôåNote :\
>For user's convenience, a standalone standalone executable (**AutoNodestone_PyQt_start.exe**) is provided.\
>You can execute the program without setting-up envierment.\
>This .exe file is created from python script (**AutoNodestone_PyQt_start.py**) using [PyInstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/).


## üïπUsage
Inside your AutoNodestone directory, open a command prompt and run : 
```
python AutoNodestone_PyQt_start.py
```
OR\
Just doble click **AutoNodestone_PyQt_start.exe**
<br/>
