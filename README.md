Python program for MapleStory that help palyer find ideal combination of Nodestones.

- Uses [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) to automatic identify Nodestone Skills.  
- Formulates the combination problem as an [integer linear programming (ILP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) problem .
- Uses [PuLP](https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/) to solve ILP problem.
